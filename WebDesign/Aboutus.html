	 <h2>Our Company</h2>

	 <p>To say Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true. That&#39;s the essence of what we do &#150; but it hardly tells the whole story.</p>

	 <p>Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. Why do they insist on Starbucks? Because they know they can count on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere and a superb cup of expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.</p>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <h2>Expect More Than Coffee</h2>

	 <p>We&#39;re not just passionate purveyors of coffee, but everything else that goes with a full and rewarding coffeehouse experience. We also offer a selection of premium Tazo&#174; teas, fine pastries and other delectable treats to please the taste buds. And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal. </p>

	 <p>It&#39;s not unusual to see people coming to Starbucks to chat, meet up or even work. We are a neighbourhood gathering place, a part of the daily routine &#150; and we couldn&#39;t be happier about it. Get to know us and you&#39;ll see: we are so much more than what we brew.</p>

	 <h2>Starbucks in the UK and Ireland</h2>
	 <p>In May 1998, Starbucks successfully entered the European market through its acquisition of 65 Seattle Coffee Company stores in the UK. The two companies shared a common culture, focusing on a great commitment to customised coffee, similar company values and a mutual respect for people and the environment. The first Starbucks Coffee Company store in the Republic of Ireland was launched in August 2005 at Dundrum Town Centre, followed by a second store at College Green in Dublin in September.</p>
